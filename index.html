									<p>I became an engineer because I am passionate about technology. This also includes computer science, in which I have considerable experience. Through my work with testing systems and mobile machines, I have developed a strong understanding of mechatronics, especially in connection with sensors, actuators, and CAN networks.<br> Also, I can make a pretty decent pizza dough.</p>

									<h3>About Me</h3>
									<h4> Bio </h4>
									<article>
										<p>
										Born and raised in a very small town in northern Germany, near Vechta, I am the third of four children. I spent my childhood on a farm-like property, where I had the opportunity to explore, learn many practical things, and use any tools I liked. I am very grateful for that. I was always very interested in technical subjects. After finishing school—with its ups and downs—I started studying mechanical engineering. For me, this was the most technical field of work, and thanks to my strong interest in it, I was able to earn my degree despite the challenges.
										<br><br>
										My first job was at Stankowitz Test Equipment through the engineering supplier Ferchau Engineering. The company works on test stands for the automotive industry, especially for car seats. There, I did my first professional programming with LabVIEW, which I really enjoyed. After that, I switched—again through Ferchau—to Boge Elastmetall GmbH, where I also wrote my master’s thesis. I had the chance to work in the testing department and develop code for test stands. This time, the focus was often on noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH), as well as durability testing. We dealt with many physical aspects, and I gained a lot of hands-on experience in this area.
										<br>
										In 2023, I moved to Terberg HS GmbH, where I currently work as a Controls and Software Engineer. Here, I design control systems for mobile machines and telemetry systems. I always wanted to work with heavy mobile machinery, and in this role, I have learned a lot about CAN communication, hydraulic control systems, and camera integration.
										<br><br>
										I am a very curious person and enjoy learning new things. I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. I am also a team player and enjoy working with others to achieve common goals. I believe that communication and collaboration are key to success in any project.
